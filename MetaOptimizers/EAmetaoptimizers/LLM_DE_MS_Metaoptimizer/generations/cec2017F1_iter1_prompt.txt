    **Task**: Design a novel and effective mutation equality for this optimization problem according to the relationship among the decision vectors [1,2,3;4,5,6], fitness vectors [1;2], and constraints violation [0;1] for this population to generate offspring.
    
    **Requirement**:
    1. Output the update equality or rules using mathematics equality or pseudo code in latex format.
    2. Output a correct and complete MATLAB code file named 'updateFunc1.m', the function need to define as follows:
       function [offspring] = updateFunc1(popdecs, popfits, cons)
    2. The update function prefers vectorization operations and avoiding using toolbox functions.
    
    **History Feedback**:
    Nothing
    
    **Output Farmat**:
    %%latexStart
    % update rule
    %%latexEnd

    %%matlabStart
    % MATLAB Code
    %%matlabEnd
